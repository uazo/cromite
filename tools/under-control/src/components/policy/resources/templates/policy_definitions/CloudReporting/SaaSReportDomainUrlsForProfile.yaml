caption: Specifies a list of SaaS domains that will be reported for managed profile
desc: |-
  This policy controls <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> reporting of SaaS domain visits and content transfers for a managed profile.

  When the policy is set, the URLs matching SaaS domains will be used to generate report and uploaded. Unmatched URLs will be ignored.

  When the policy is not set or set to an empty list, no report will be generated.

  The matching patterns use a similar format to those for the '<ph name="URL_BLOCKLIST_POLICY_NAME">URLBlocklist</ph>' policy, which are documented at https://support.google.com/chrome/a?p=url_blocklist_filter_format. With a few exceptions below:

   * URL host must match the hostname or be a subdomain of the hostname of one of the domains from the SaaS sites list.

   * URL path must start with the path from the matched SaaS sites list entry.

   * The URL scheme, port, query are disregarded during the matching process.

  This policy can only be set as a cloud user policy.

  This policy value is populated by the cloud policy infrastructure and admins can't set it directly.
