  Specifies whether the user may open pages in Incognito mode in <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph>.

        If 'Enabled' is selected or the policy is left unset, pages may be opened in Incognito mode.

        If 'Disabled' is selected, pages may not be opened in Incognito mode.

        If 'Forced' is selected, pages may be opened ONLY in Incognito mode. Note that 'Forced' does not work for Android-on-Chrome

        The <ph name="INCOGNITO_MODE_URL_ALLOWLIST_POLICY_NAME">IncognitoModeUrlAllowlist</ph> policy takes precedence over this policy and can re-enable Incognito mode for specific URLs. When Incognito mode is disabled by this policy when an allowlist is provided, Incognito mode is available only for URLs matching the allowlist, while all other pages are blocked.

        Note: On iOS, if the policy is changed during a session, it will only take effect on relaunch.
