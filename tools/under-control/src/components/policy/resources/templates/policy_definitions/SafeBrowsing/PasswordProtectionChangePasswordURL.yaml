caption: Configure the change password URL.
desc: |-
  Setting the policy sets the URL for users to change their password after seeing a warning in the browser. The password protection service sends users to the URL (HTTP and HTTPS protocols only) you designate through this policy. For <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> to correctly capture the salted hash of the new password on this change password page, make sure your change password page follows these guidelines ( https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/create-amazing-password-forms ).

  Turning the policy off or leaving it unset means the service sends users to https://myaccount.google.com to change their password.
