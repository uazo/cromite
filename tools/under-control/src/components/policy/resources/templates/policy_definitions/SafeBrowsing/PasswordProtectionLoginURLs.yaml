caption: Configure the list of enterprise login URLs where password protection service
  should capture salted hashes of passwords.
desc: |-
  Setting the policy sets the list of enterprise login URLs (HTTP and HTTPS protocols only). Password protection service will capture salted hashes of passwords on these URLs and use them for password reuse detection. For <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> to correctly capture password salted hashes, ensure your sign-in pages follow these guidelines ( https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/create-amazing-password-forms ).

  Turning this setting off or leaving it unset means the password protection service only captures the password salted hashes on https://accounts.google.com.
