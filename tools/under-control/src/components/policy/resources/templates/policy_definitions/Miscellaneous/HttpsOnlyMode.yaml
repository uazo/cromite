caption: Allow HTTPS-Only Mode to be enabled
default: allowed
desc: |-
  This policy controls whether users can enable HTTPS-Only Mode (Always Use Secure Connections) in Settings. HTTPS-Only Mode upgrades all navigations to HTTPS.

  If this setting is not set or set to "allowed", users will be allowed to enable HTTPS-Only Mode.

  If this setting is set to "disallowed", HTTPS-Only Mode will be disabled.

  If this setting is set to "force_enabled", HTTPS-Only Mode will be enabled in Strict mode.

  If this setting is set to "force_balanced_enabled", HTTPS-Only Mode will be enabled in Balanced mode.

  "force_enabled" is supported from M112 onwards, "force_balanced_enabled" is supported from M129 onwards.

  "force_enabled" and "force_balanced_enabled" can be recommended to users too.
  HTTPS-Only Mode will be set Strict or Balanced initially but users are allowed to
  change it.

  If you set this policy to a value that is not supported by the version of Chrome that receives the policy, Chrome will default to the allowed setting.

  The separate <ph name="HTTP_ALLOWLIST_POLICY_NAME">HttpAllowlist</ph> policy
  can be used to exempt specific hostnames or hostname patterns from being
  upgraded to HTTPS by this feature.
