caption: Force foreground priority for all tabs
desc: |-
  This policy controls whether background web content is forced to run at
  foreground priority.

  By default, the browser optimizes resources by deprioritizing content in
  background tabs. Enabling this policy overrides that behavior, causing
  background tabs to be scheduled the same way as the active tab.

  Note that forcing background content to run at foreground priority may
  slightly impact the responsiveness of the active tab.

  If this policy is set to Enabled, all web content runs at foreground priority
  regardless of its visibility state.

  If this policy is set to Disabled or not set, the browser determines priority
  based on standard heuristics (e.g., deprioritizing content that is not
  visible, not playing audio, not participating in video calls...).
