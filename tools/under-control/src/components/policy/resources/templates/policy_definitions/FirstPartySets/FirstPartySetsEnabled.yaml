caption: Enable First-Party Sets.
default: true
deprecated: true
desc: |-
  This policy is provided as a way to opt-out of the First-Party Sets feature (which was later renamed <ph name="RELATED_WEBSITE_SETS_FEATURE_NAME">Related Website Sets</ph> feature).

  When this policy is unset or set to Enabled, the First-Party Sets feature is enabled.

  When this policy is set to Disabled, the First-Party Sets feature is disabled.

  It controls whether Chrome supports First-Party Sets related integrations.

  This is the equivalent of the <ph name="RELATED_WEBSITE_SETS_ENABLED_POLICY_NAME">RelatedWebsiteSetsEnabled</ph> policy.
  Either policy may be used with the same effect on the browser's behavior.
  Both these policies are deprecated following <ph name="RELATED_WEBSITE_SETS_FEATURE_NAME">Related Website Sets</ph> feature deprecation in <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> version 144.
