caption: List of URL patterns for which <ph name="CHROME_DEVTOOLS_NAME">Chrome DevTools</ph> are allowed to be opened
desc: |-
  This policy can be used to allow <ph name="CHROME_DEVTOOLS_NAME">Chrome DevTools</ph> on specific URLs.

  URL patterns are matched against the URL of the page being inspected. If a match is found, the <ph name="CHROME_DEVTOOLS_NAME">Chrome DevTools</ph> are allowed. This applies even if the URL also matches the <ph name="DEVELOPER_TOOLS_AVAILABILITY_BLOCKLIST_POLICY_NAME">DeveloperToolsAvailabilityBlocklist</ph> policy, even if the <ph name="DEVELOPER_TOOLS_AVAILABILITY_POLICY_NAME">DeveloperToolsAvailability</ph> policy is set to disallow (value 2). For information on the URL format, see https://support.google.com/chrome/a?p=url_blocklist_filter_format.

  Leaving the policy unset means this allowlist has no effect.

  If this policy is set and <ph name="DEVELOPER_TOOLS_AVAILABILITY_BLOCKLIST_POLICY_NAME">DeveloperToolsAvailabilityBlocklist</ph> is not, any URL not on this list will be blocked.

  If both this and the <ph name="DEVELOPER_TOOLS_AVAILABILITY_BLOCKLIST_POLICY_NAME">DeveloperToolsAvailabilityBlocklist</ph> policies are set, this allowlist takes precedence. If a URL matches a pattern on the allowlist, it will be allowed. If it matches a pattern on the blocklist (but not the allowlist), it will be blocked. If a URL matches neither, the <ph name="DEVELOPER_TOOLS_AVAILABILITY_POLICY_NAME">DeveloperToolsAvailability</ph> policy will be used as a fallback.

  If neither policy is set, the availability is determined by the <ph name="DEVELOPER_TOOLS_AVAILABILITY_POLICY_NAME">DeveloperToolsAvailability</ph> policy.

  This policy also applies to <ph name="CHROME_DEVTOOLS_NAME">Chrome DevTools</ph> opened for extensions and web applications.

  This policy is limited to 1,000 entries.
